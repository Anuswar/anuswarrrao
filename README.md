# Portfolio Website

This is the code for my personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a web developer. 

## Description

The website includes the following sections:

- **Home** - A hero section with my picture, name, title and a call to action to download my resume
- **Skills** - Technical skills organized in a grid 
- **Projects** - Grid display of thumbnail images linking to external sites 
- **Contact** - Contact form with fields for name, email and message

It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript without relying on frameworks or libraries. Key functionality includes:

- Mobile responsive design
- Custom cursor effects 
- Animated scroll behavior 
- Form validation and submission

## Usage

The site is currently deployed at [anuswarrrao.com](https://anuswarrrao.netlify.app). Feel free to look around and contact me!

You can also clone or download the code to use it for your own portfolio website. Make sure to update the details, links, project thumbnails and resume to your own.
