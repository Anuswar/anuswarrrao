# Portfolio Website

This is the code for my personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a web developer.

## Description

The website includes the following sections:

- **Home** - A hero section with my picture, name, title and a call to action to download my resume
- **Skills** - Technical skills organized in a grid
- **Projects** - Grid display of thumbnail images linking to external sites
- **Contact** - Contact form with fields for name, email and message

It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript without relying on frameworks or libraries. Key functionality includes:

- Mobile responsive design
- Custom cursor effects
- Animated scroll behavior
- Form validation and submission
